When Apple announced M1, I was a frustrated ML engineer spending $500/month on cloud GPUs. The moment I compiled TensorFlow on M1 MacBook Air and saw those Metal performance numbers, everything changed! Started with a simple Reddit post: 'Running BERT on M1 - You Won't Believe These Numbers' - it exploded with 5K upvotes. People begged for tutorials, so I recorded my first video on my iPhone: 'PyTorch on Apple Silicon in 5 Minutes'. Within a week: 50K views! The channel name? 'Tech' + 'Navigation' - helping people navigate the new world of Apple ML. Early struggles: Apple's documentation was sparse, had to reverse-engineer Metal kernels, and the community was skeptical. The breakthrough: When I got Stable Diffusion running on base M1 before anyone else - that video changed everything! From bedroom recording to full studio in 3 years. The mission remains: democratize AI with consumer hardware!"}
